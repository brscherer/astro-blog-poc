# ðŸš€ Astro

There are five core design principles about why Astro was created

1. Content-focused: Astro was designed for content-rich websites.
2. Server-first: Websites run faster when they render HTML on the server.
3. Fast by default: It should be impossible to build a slow website in Astro.
4. Easy to use: You donâ€™t need to be an expert to build something with Astro.
5. Fully-featured, but flexible: Over 100+ Astro integrations to choose from.

## Content Focused

Astro is fast because it's unique focus is content. It lets Astro make tradeoffs and deliver features that wouldn't make sense for app-focused web frameworks to implement

## Server First

Astro leverage server-side rendering over client-side rendering because SPA adds more complexity and harm page performance, including critical metrics like Time to Interactive (TTI)

## Fast by Default

Astro combines content focus with a server first MPA architecture, which allows making tradeoffs and deliver features other frameworks cannot.

## Easy to Use

Astro's goal is to be accessible to every web developer regardless of skill level or past experience.
It allows using any favorite UI component languages and borrowed part of its syntax from other well-known frameworks.
Because it was designed to run on the server, we don't need to care with reactivity, so all that complexity goes away.

## Fully featured, but flexible

Astro comes with everything we need to build a website, but also is UI-agnostic, which means you can bring your own UI framework such as React, Vue, Solid and other that are officially supported in Astro. We can also mix frameworks on the same page, making future migrations easier and preventing project lock-in to a single framework.
